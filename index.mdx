## What is Celo Names?

Celo Names are L2 ENS names on the Celo network. They let users register human‑readable names and use them as onchain identity across apps, leveraging ENS-compatible infrastructure deployed on Celo.

- Resolve names to addresses and addresses to primary names
- Set text records (e.g. avatar, twitter, website) and addr records per chain
- Fully onchain, ENS-compatible (ENSIP‑10)
