### What are Celo Names?
Celo Names are ENS-compatible names on the Celo network, enabling human‑readable identities that resolve to addresses and onchain records.

### Do Celo Names work across chains?
Yes. Apps that are ENSIP‑10 compliant can resolve names and records across chains, similar to Basenames on Base.

### How do I set my primary name?
You set a reverse record for your address so apps can display a name for an address. See the future guide: "How to set L2 primary name".

### Can I transfer my name?
Yes. See the Transfer Guide for ownership semantics and post‑transfer steps.
